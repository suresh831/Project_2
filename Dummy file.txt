git push origin master --force
git remote set-url origin <correct-URL>  [This should show the URL for origin. If it's not pointing to the right place, you can set it like so] 
git log origin/master..HEAD  [ Run this command to see if there are any local commits that haven’t been pushed to the remote] 
git push origin master
It’s also possible that the remote master branch has changes that you don’t have locally. You can fetch those changes and merge them with your local branch:
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git push origin master --force
git add ../README.md [ if some files miss then ADD and push  ] 
git add ../index.html
git add -A
git commit -m "Add new files and update README, delete index.html"
git push origin master
